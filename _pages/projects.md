## Reading Project: Lawrence Evans, _Partial Differential Equations_

In September 2020, I started reading the classic text on PDE by Lawrence Evans. I am keeping a running set of latex notes here.
I compiled the notes as I went along with the text, and they mostly consist of elaborations on points left unexplained in Evans' book.
They are not intended as a replacement to the original text.

## Music Theory Project

Details on this project are forthcoming, but me and a colleague are working on some research involving a mathematical aspect of music theory.
A writeup should be on this website shortly!
