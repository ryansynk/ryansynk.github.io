I'm a recent graduate of the University of Maryland, College Park, where I earned degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. 
I am passionate about problems at the intersection of computing and mathematics, including scientific and high-performance computing, 
numerical analysis, optimization, and machine learning. 

I am currently seeking jobs in software engineering and data science.
